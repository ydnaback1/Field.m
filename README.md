# Field Maps

Field Maps is a lightweight, static Leaflet app for planning walking routes across the UK and a worldwide OpenStreetMap view. Routes are saved locally in your browser so you can return to them later without a backend.

## Features
- Toggle between UK and worldwide map views.
- Draw, edit, and delete routes using the floating routes panel.
- View distance and estimated walking time for the selected route.
- Export routes as GeoJSON or GPX, and share routes via a URL.
- Persist map position, zoom, and saved routes in localStorage.
